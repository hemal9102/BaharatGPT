**Project Goal**:

An AI-powered **chatbot** that teaches **digital literacy, coding, and soft skills** in **local languages**, designed for  ‚Äî focused on rural and underserved students.

---
Create a modern, mobile-friendly chat UI using HTML and Tailwind CSS.

Features:
- A fixed header that says "BharatGPT ‚Äì AI Chat for Students"
- A scrollable chat window that displays chat bubbles (left for AI, right for user)
- A simple input bar at the bottom with a text box and a "Send" button
- Light background, soft colors, clean layout (rounded, shadows)
- Responsive layout (works well on mobile and desktop)
- Dummy chat messages (one user, one AI) to show the layout
- Add comments in HTML to indicate where to inject real messages later

## üöÄ **Day-by-Day Plan**

### ‚úÖ **Day 1: Set up AI chatbot**



**üì¶ Example Python Code Starter:**

```python
from telegram import Update
from telegram.ext import ApplicationBuilder, CommandHandler, MessageHandler, ContextTypes, filters
import openai

openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

async def start(update: Update, context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE):
    await update.message.reply_text("üôè Namaste! I'm BharatGPT. Ask me anything to learn digital skills or basic coding.")

async def handle_message(update: Update, context: ContextTypes.DEFAULT_TYPE):
    user_msg = update.message.text
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_msg}]
    )
    reply = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
    await update.message.reply_text(reply)

app = ApplicationBuilder().token("YOUR_BOT_TOKEN").build()
app.add_handler(CommandHandler("start", start))
app.add_handler(MessageHandler(filters.TEXT & (~filters.COMMAND), handle_message))

app.run_polling()
```

---

### ‚úÖ **Day 2: Add Subject Topics (Digital, Coding)**

* [ ] Define 5‚Äì7 lessons like:

  * "What is Internet?"
  * "How to open Gmail?"
  * "What is HTML?"
  * "Python print(), variables"
* [ ] Save lessons in JSON/YAML for retrieval
* [ ] Inject topics into GPT responses as system prompt

**Example Prompt:**

```text
You are a friendly rural AI teacher. The user wants to learn digital literacy. Use simple words. If they ask for help, explain with real examples in Hindi too.
```

---

### ‚úÖ **Day 3: Local Language + Quizzes**

google translate PAI using google cloud console and connect with n8n workflow which will reply and this will translate it 
* [ ] Auto-translate lesson text and chatbot replies
* [ ] Add multiple-choice quizzes
* [ ] Collect quiz answers via buttons in Telegram or Streamlit

**Bonus:** Give a score, motivation message

---

### ‚úÖ **Day 4: Certificates + Tracking**

* [ ] Save learner name + topic progress to Google Sheet
* [ ] Use `ReportLab` to generate basic PDF certificates
* [ ] Auto-send it via to the web app that i have created using lovable or bolt or vercel  


### ‚úÖ **Day 5: Polish + Deploy + Submit**

* [ ] Polish UI/UX (welcome messages, emojis, typing animation)
* [ ] Deploy Streamlit app or run Telegram bot 24/7 using:

  * Render / Railway / PythonAnywhere
* [ ] Record video demo (screen + narration)
* [ ] Submit all files: GitHub repo, video, and project PDF

Now we have to build account authentication system i guess so user can login and My n8n AI agent also tracks its progress if the user is learning one or more perticular language and after completely learnig it and then my ai agent gives quiz to user according to what ai agent taught him and after user passes this tests . user successfully finishes the course and gets certification according to it also with grade

if user improves and also again he wants to give test i have to build that into UI or idk how should i integrate this idea  

Absolutely! You're now transitioning your project into something powerful and impactful ‚Äì an AI-based learning platform with:

Authentication (login/signup)

AI-driven teaching flow

Progress tracking

Quizzes + grading

Certification

Re-attempts & improvement

Inclusiveness for rural/underserved learners

Let‚Äôs break this down into clear development milestones aligned with your goal:

‚ÄúCreate an accessible AI-based platform that helps rural and underserved students acquire digital literacy, coding skills, or vocational training, bridging the digital divide.‚Äù

‚úÖ PHASE 1: Authentication & User Profiles
üîπ Features:
Sign up / Login system (Django auth or Firebase auth)

User roles: Student, maybe Admin

User Profile: language preference, progress (per topic), quiz history, certification status

üîπ Why it matches the goal:
Helps track individual growth

Gives rural learners personalized access

‚úÖ PHASE 2: AI-Powered Learning Flow
üîπ Features:
Your existing AI agent teaches coding concepts (Python, HTML, etc.)

Lessons broken into modules

Track which module a user is on

Text + audio/video support for low-literacy users

üîπ Why it matches the goal:
Gives structured digital/coding education in local language

AI makes learning accessible and interactive

‚úÖ PHASE 3: Progress Tracking System
üîπ Features:
Store completed lessons per user

Store AI‚Äôs feedback (like understanding level, retry counts, doubts)

Dashboards for student (see what‚Äôs left) and admin (see insights)

‚úÖ PHASE 4: Quiz + Certification System
